          Virtual tour of an Ecopod made for  OceanBuilders with our agency partner Top Innovation
          Lab in Panama.  In the words of OceanBuilders, Ecopods are high tech floating *homes*
          in the shape of Pods. They are futuristic & allows you to Live Just Above the Waves
        </p>
        <p className="text-grey text-base md:text-lg mt-6">
          On February 3th, 2019 we made history. We successfully launched a full
          size prototype floating home suitable for life on
          the ocean. It was launched in international waters 13 miles off 
          the coast of Thailand. After only a few months in the water it had become 
          a habitat for a thriving community for tens of thousands of fish and other sea 
          life where there was no life before. It was an eco-restoration success story.
          We have received significant international media coverage from around the world 
          and our story is being written into a book and possibly a screenplay for a movie 
          that will tell the full story that has never been told.
          *You can find us now working in co-operation with the government of Panama to 
          create what we believe will be a very special floating community of eco-restorative
          floating smart-homes in Panama(from: https://oceanbuilders.com/press/)

          Toggle Tech Lab had the pleasure of working on this product for Ecopodâ€™s launch
          party in Panama city, Panama. We developed a PC VR experience with  high fidelity 
          graphics of the interior of an Ecopod coupled with sounds of the waves 
          and birds chirping, to allow for a more  immersive experience. The user
          can teleport through  various parts of the EcoPod to explore it.
