          Imagine learning about your diagnosis in VR as the doctor in the
          office walks you through your body, layer by layer. This is what this
          proof of concept aim to do. Made for a medical company that offers
          patients a way to learn more about their diagnosis in VR.

        <p className="text-grey text-base md:text-lg mt-6">
          Unlike other 3The 3D model used is one of a real patient. A scan of a
          patient has been converted into a 3D model which is then projected in
          VR.
        </p>
        <p className="text-grey text-base md:text-lg mt-6">
          The initial proof of concept went through iterations in order to
          finesse the scan into a 3D model which could then be used in VR.
          Eventually coming to a stage where each layer of the body such as the
          skin, muscles, tissue could be unmasked to zoom in and out into key
          organs of the body relevant to the patientâ€™s diagnosis.
